<h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>
<p>This repository is an example on how to use a Github Action.</p>
<p>It has a Markdown file and using a Github Action uses Pandoc to generate HTML, PDF, etc. and pushes the generated files into another Github repo.</p>
<p>Now it has stricter shell options.</p>
<p>And now… names in entrypoint.sh and names in action.yml are aligned.</p>
